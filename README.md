## Some observations about this project
The calculator is a simple calculator but it has the power to solve small calculations like subtraction, addition, division...
It is important to note that the visual interaction of this content was not developed by me. The visual interface was reused from a class taken in a [Full-Stack Web Development Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/curso-web-design-fundamentos-aprenda-html-css-e-javascript/) on the course platform [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com).

## Why does this project exist?
This project came about as a way to exercise JavaScript in a practical way, being the first project I did in JavaScript. If you're just starting out in this programming language, it's a project that I highly recommend, because in addition to teaching basic but useful JavaScript functions, you'll get a broader view of JavaScript programming. If you haven't been able to do it correctly, try again until you do!
